### 🌍 What is the language selector for?
The language selector has three options:

- **Auto**: Uses your browser language (currently English or Spanish). Other languages default to English.  
- **Spanish**: Always uses Spanish.  
- **English**: Always uses English.  

The selected language determines which KillBait version the URL is checked against. You can submit articles in any language, but summaries will match your selected language.
